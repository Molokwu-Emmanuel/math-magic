# math-magic
## From codeacademy project
## In this project, you will become a mathemagician and write a small program that performs a mathematical magic trick!
### Now, go back to your code and change myNumber to any other integer. Run your program again.
### Note: Due to the range of the int primitive data type, only set myNumber to integer values between -46,341 and 46,340 (both inclusive). Values outside of this range for myNumber will cause the value of stepOne to exceed the maximum possible value of int when we multiply myNumber by itself, which can cause the program to produce unexpected results!
